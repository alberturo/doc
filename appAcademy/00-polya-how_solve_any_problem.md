1. Understand the problem

```
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Input: [0,1,0,3,12] Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

* You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
* Minimize the total number of operations.
```

2. Make a plan

```
1. Set a pointer to the last element in the array.
2. Walk through each element of the array.
3. If the element is zero, swap its position with the element at the pointer,
   then decrement the pointer.
```

3. Carry out the plan

```
function moveZeroes(nums) {
    // 1. Set a pointer to the last element in the array.
    let last = nums.length - 1;

    // 2. Walk through each element of the array.
    for (let i = 0 ; i < last ; i++) {

        // 3. If the element is zero,
        if (nums[i] == 0) {
            // swap its position with the element at the pointer
            [nums[i], nums[last]] = [nums[last], nums[i]];

            // then decrement the pointer.
            last--;
        }
    }

    return nums;
}
```

4. Look back and improve your solution

```
it's always good to revisit your code and make improvements. Sometimes that means fixing bugs or testing edge cases. Sometimes it means optimizing your code for readability or efficiency.
