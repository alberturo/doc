/*
Define a function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) that will print every number from lowNum to highNum, inclusive. Inclusive means that the range includes lowNum and highNum.
Hint: this function only needs to print using console.log it does not need to return.
*/

function logBetween(lowNum, highNum) {
  let result = 0;
  while (lowNum <= highNum) {
    console.log("this number #: " + lowNum);
    lowNum++;
    result += lowNum;
  }
  return result;
}

// Examples:
logBetween(-1, 2); // prints out:
-1;
0;
1;
2;

logBetween(14, 6); // => prints nothing

logBetween(4, 6); // prints out:
4;
5;
6;
